## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. This site has been created for educational purposes and is not intended as sole source of information.

## Features

There are several sections defined; HTML, CSS, Advanced CSS, Git, JavaScript and so much more.

## How to Contribute

I would appreciate any insight to making it more functional and pretty. I'm also looking to put in pages for how to do something step by step; example: cloning and creating a branch on GitHub using Git Bash and putting changes made on GitHub using Git Bash.

## Tests

- Making sure links work
- Open your browser of choice,
- Click the link,
- Does it take you to where it says?
