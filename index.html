            <li>JavaScript links should be in the body at the very end.</li>
            <li>The 'sript' link has to be at the bottom just before the end because if it loads before your HTML that is suppose to be effected 
              by that code, then there could be issues loading or performing that task.</li>
            <li>addEventListener() function is if you need something to happen like a click.</li>
            <li>querySelector() is like when you call a tag in CSS.</li>
