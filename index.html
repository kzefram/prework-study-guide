        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>These elements are nested in between open and closing tags.</li>
          <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark-up Language.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html lets the browser know what type of document it is and version.</li>
          <li>HTML tags are like a container and everything that has to do with your website/web app.</li>
          <li>A parent is the first level of code. The HTML tag at the top is a parent.</li>
          <li>A child is nested inside of a parent tag. The tag 'head' is a child of HTML. <br>
          <img src="./assets/hierarcy.png" alt="A picture of the hierarcy" id= "img2"/>

          <li>br puts in a line break and not all the space creating a new line does.</li>
          <li>hr put a horizontal rule line to seperate something like paragraphs or sections.</li>
          <li>These to examples are call self-closing tags. They do not need a second like head and p does.</li>
          <li>Comments are useful. They are done with open bracket!--- YOUR COMMENT ---closing bracket.</li>
          <li>Lits are done with the following tags: ul, ol, li. They are not self closing.</li>
          <li>Blocked items will take up the whole width of the screen.</li>
          <li>Inline only takes up the amount of room need to display the content. Other items can sit next to one another.</li>
          <li>Inline also means the formating inside the first tag brackets. Example: style.</li>
          <li>Meta tags live inside the 'head' tags. This is where you can define information about the file. Meta tags are useful for
            all kinds of things especially SEO.
          </li>
          <li>Examples of Meta tags: Charset, Name, Content, Author.

              <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
              <li>git checkout main will change the branch to main. If you want to change it to another branch, it's done the same
                way.

              <li>Commit is followed my -m "YOUR MESSAGE" to let others know what changes you have made.</li>
              <li>Branches are different versions of your file to be able to compare later in case you don't like something.</li>
              <li>Pull Requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on github.</li>
              <li>A repository is where all of your project's files and each file's revision history is stored. Github is a cloud based 
                storage.
              </li>
              <li>Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history; the main branch.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript makes your site: HTML(set-up), CSS(decorating), JavaScript(dancing).</li>
            <li>Don't forget those blinking semicolons!!</li>
            <li>JavaScript links should be in the body at the very end.</li>
            <li>The 'sript' link has to be at the bottom just before the end because if it loads before your HTML that is suppose to be effected by that code, then there could be issues loading or performing that task.</li>
            <li>addEventListener() function is if you need something to happen like a click.</li>
            <li>querySelector() is like when you call a tag in CSS.</li>
            <li>alert() creates a pop-up.</li>
            <li>const is constant like in C#. They are imutable which means they cannot be changed.</li>
            <li>Variables are like any language; a container. They  are a place to store data until it is needed. <br/>
            Syntax<br/>
            - var name1;  (undefined)<br/>
            - var name1 = value1;  (declared)<br/>
            - var name1 = value1, name2 = value2;<br/>
            </li>
            <li>A triple = sign tells the computer to return a boolean if the two variables are equal. This is a comparison operator</li>
            <li>To set an image, you use the setAttribute() function with attributes; example: src, image adddress in quotes.</li>
            <li>A place to go for more information: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#comments">Click Here</a></li>
            <li>Function are like in C# and Python and do the same thing. So learn one and the rest come easier. You can recall them over and over without rewriting all that code over and over.</li>
            <li>The 'let' function intializes the variable.</li>
            <li>There are also the if/else statements that work the same. And use curly brackets like C#.</li>
            <li>Comments for a multiple lines are done /* ending with */</li>
            <li>Comments for a single line is is //.</li>
            <li>A 'for' loop contiues to loop until the it has reached the goal and does this so you don't have to write all those lines of code</li>
            <li>You need to put the data type to make a variable. example: var me = "Karen";</li>
            <li>To intialize a variable, you need to use the word set. </li>
            <li>If statements are similar to C#.
              <img src="./assets/ifstatement.png" alt="a picture of an example of in file syling" id="img6"/>
            </li>
            <li>control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Making a function - the word function and then the name, code block with the instructions, then call the function.</li>
            <li>Fuction is a set of instructions that can be called upon many times without having to write out the same code many times.</li>
            <li>Like CSS, it is easier to make a seperate file. Example: JavaScript.js</li>
            <li>For js, a primitive is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are seven typese: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, null.</li>
            <li>All primitives are immutable; they cannot be altered. Some cufusion can happen. Priitive itself vs a variable assigned a primitive value.</li>
            <li>Primitives have no methods, however, behave as if they do.</li>
            <li>Scripts are linked at the bottom and this is because you want to load the HTML & CSS to sure all the buttons are in the right place so the JS can funtion properly.</li>
            <li>Operator: </li>
              <ul>
                <li>!== means not equal to</li>
                <li>&& means 'and', both espressions have to be true or vice versa.</li>
                <li>|| means 'or', example: if one of the varables is true then the answer is true</li>
                <li>'Pipes' are found on the keyboard, sometimes over the backslash.</li>
                <li>console.log(!Expression2); means not equal to.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Expressions can be stored in a variable: example: expression1 = <code>(1!<0)</code></li>
            <li>if... else if... else... are used to create conditional statements. Example:</li>
            <li>It means if the variable is equal to 12, then it will print the phrase to the console, other wise, it will print the other phrase.</li>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  if (lunch === 12) {
                    console.log("Yay! I'm starving!");
                  }
                  else {
                    console.log("ah! man! It isn't lunch yet.");
                  }
                </code>
              </pre>
            <li>Switch is also used here like in C# and works the same way. Default is the same as else.</li>
          </ul>
